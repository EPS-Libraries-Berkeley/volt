We begin with a general description for optical properties of\\ngraphene, particularly focusing on the dispersion of graphene-plasmon\\npolaritons. The dispersion relation of graphene-plasmon polaritons of spatially\\nextended graphene is expressed in terms of the local response limit with\\nintraband contribution. With this theoretical foundation of graphene-plasmon\\npolaritons, we then discuss recent exciting progress, paying specific attention\\nto the following topics: excitation of graphene plasmon polaritons,\\nelectron-phonon interactions in graphene on polar substrates, and tunable\\ngraphene plasmonics with applications in modulators and sensors. Finally, we\\nseek to address some of the apparent challenges and promising perspectives of\\ngraphene plasmonics.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'The chemical modification of graphene with adatoms is of importance for\\nnanoelectronics applications. Based on first-principles density-functional\\ntheory calculations with including van der Waals interactions, we present a\\ncomparative study of the diffusion characteristics of oxygen (O) and fluorine\\n(F) atoms both on graphene and between the layers of bilayer graphene. We find\\nthat O and F atoms have lower binding energies between the layers of bilayer\\ngraphene compared to on graphene. Interestingly, the calculated diffusion\\nbarrier for the O atom slightly increases from 0.81 eV on graphene to 0.85 eV\\nwithin bilayer graphene, while that for the F atom significantly decreases from\\n0.30 eV on graphene to 0.18 eV within bilayer graphene. Such contrasting\\nbehaviors of the O and F diffusions within bilayer graphene can be traced to\\ntheir different bonding natures: i.e., the O adatom that has a strongly\\ncovalent C$-$O$-$C bonding on the bridge site of the C$-$C bond diffuses on one\\ngraphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer, while the F\\nadatom that has a weakly ionic F$-$C bonding on top of a C atom easily diffuses\\nby hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges\\nfrom the two layers. The present findings have important implications for\\nunderstanding the diffusion processes of F and O atoms on graphene and within\\nbilayer graphene.',\n",

       "   'value': 'The chemical modification of graphene with adatoms is of importance for\\nnanoelectronics applications. Based on first-principles density-functional\\ntheory calculations with including van der Waals interactions, we present a\\ncomparative study of the diffusion characteristics of oxygen (O) and fluorine\\n(F) atoms both on graphene and between the layers of bilayer graphene. We find\\nthat O and F atoms have lower binding energies between the layers of bilayer\\ngraphene compared to on graphene. Interestingly, the calculated diffusion\\nbarrier for the O atom slightly increases from 0.81 eV on graphene to 0.85 eV\\nwithin bilayer graphene, while that for the F atom significantly decreases from\\n0.30 eV on graphene to 0.18 eV within bilayer graphene. Such contrasting\\nbehaviors of the O and F diffusions within bilayer graphene can be traced to\\ntheir different bonding natures: i.e., the O adatom that has a strongly\\ncovalent C$-$O$-$C bonding on the bridge site of the C$-$C bond diffuses on one\\ngraphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer, while the F\\nadatom that has a weakly ionic F$-$C bonding on top of a C atom easily diffuses\\nby hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges\\nfrom the two layers. The present findings have important implications for\\nunderstanding the diffusion processes of F and O atoms on graphene and within\\nbilayer graphene.'},\n",

Detailed analysis of Raman spectra of graphene\\ndeposited on different nanowire substrates shows that bigger differences in\\nnanowires height increase graphene strain, while higher number of nanowires in\\ncontact with graphene locally reduce the strain. Moreover, the value of\\ngraphene carrier concentration is found to be correlated with the density of\\nnanowires in contact with graphene. Analysis of intensity ratios of Raman G, D\\nand D' bands enable to trace how nanowire substrate impacts the defect\\nconcentration and type. The lowest concentration of defects is observed for\\ngraphene deposited on nanowires of the lowest density. Contact between graphene\\nand densely arranged nanowires leads to a large density of vacancies. On the\\nother hand, grain boundaries are the main type of defects in graphene on rarely\\ndistributed nanowires. Our results also show modification of graphene carrier\\nconcentration and strain by different types of defects present in graphene.\"},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Two experimental studies reported the spontaneous formation of amorphous and\\ncrystalline structures of C60 intercalated between graphene and a substrate.\\nThey observed interesting phenomena ranging from reaction between C60 molecules\\nunder graphene to graphene sagging between the molecules and control of strain\\nin graphene. Motivated by these works, we performed fully atomistic reactive\\nmolecular dynamics simulations to study the formation and thermal stability of\\ngraphene wrinkles as well as graphene attachment to and detachment from the\\nsubstrate when graphene is laid over a previously distributed array of C60\\nmolecules on a copper substrate at different values of temperature. As graphene\\ncompresses the C60 molecules against the substrate, and graphene attachment to\\nthe substrate between C60s (\"C60s\" stands for plural of C60) depends on the\\nheight of graphene wrinkles, configurations with both frozen and non-frozen\\nC60s structures were investigated in order to verify the experimental result of\\nstable sagged graphene when the distance between C60s is about 4 nm and height\\nof graphene wrinkles is about 0.8 nm. Below the distance of 4 nm between C60s,\\ngraphene becomes locally suspended and less strained. We show that this happens\\nwhen C60s are allowed to deform under the compressive action of graphene. If we\\nkeep the C60s frozen, spontaneous \"blanketing\" of graphene happens only when\\nthe distance between them are equal or above 7 nm. Both above results for the\\nexistence of stable sagged graphene for C60 distances of 4 or 7 nm are shown to\\nagree with a mechanical model relating the rigidity of graphene to the energy\\nof graphene-substrate adhesion.

       "   'value': 'Two experimental studies reported the spontaneous formation of amorphous and\\ncrystalline structures of C60 intercalated between graphene and a substrate.\\nThey observed interesting phenomena ranging from reaction between C60 molecules\\nunder graphene to graphene sagging between the molecules and control of strain\\nin graphene. Motivated by these works, we performed fully atomistic reactive\\nmolecular dynamics simulations to study the formation and thermal stability of\\ngraphene wrinkles as well as graphene attachment to and detachment from the\\nsubstrate when graphene is laid over a previously distributed array of C60\\nmolecules on a copper substrate at different values of temperature. As graphene\\ncompresses the C60 molecules against the substrate, and graphene attachment to\\nthe substrate between C60s (\"C60s\" stands for plural of C60) depends on the\\nheight of graphene wrinkles, configurations with both frozen and non-frozen\\nC60s structures were investigated in order to verify the experimental result of\\nstable sagged graphene when the distance between C60s is about 4 nm and height\\nof graphene wrinkles is about 0.8 nm. Below the distance of 4 nm between C60s,\\ngraphene becomes locally suspended and less strained. We show that this happens\\nwhen C60s are allowed to deform under the compressive action of graphene. If we\\nkeep the C60s frozen, spontaneous \"blanketing\" of graphene happens only when\\nthe distance between them are equal or above 7 nm. Both above results for the\\nexistence of stable sagged graphene for C60 distances of 4 or 7 nm are shown to\\nagree with a mechanical model relating the rigidity of graphene to the energy\\nof graphene-substrate adhesion.
